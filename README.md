# Automated-Real-Estate-Form-Filler-using-Web-Scraping-and-Selenium
This project automates the process of collecting real estate data from a website and submitting it to a Google Form. It combines web scraping with Python's BeautifulSoup to extract rental property details like price, address, and links, and uses Selenium for browser automation to populate and submit the form.
